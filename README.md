A cutting-edge full-stack solution that seamlessly marries a React dashboard with a CrewAI multi-agent backend to research, draft, optimize, and publish LinkedIn posts — leveraging local Ollama/Mistral LLMs (you can use any LLM (llama3, deepseek-r1, qwen ...)) and real-time, topic-scoped trend data.

    Modular YAML-driven agents handle research, planning, writing, SEO, review, export, and publishing—easily extendable and tunable.

    Local LLM Performance
    Runs on your hardware with Ollama/Mistral, ensuring fast, private, low-latency text generation.

    Automated Cadence
    Schedule new posts every quarter-hour or trigger them manually via the dashboard.

    React-Powered Dashboard
    Intuitive UI to enter topics, preview drafts, publish to LinkedIn, and view engagement metrics—all in one place.

    Markdown Archiving
